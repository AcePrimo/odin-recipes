    <h1> The best steak I ever ate (so far) </h1>

    <h2> Sit back and I will spin you a yarn about the best steak I ever ate</h2>
    <p>I love a good steak, and when done right (notice I didn't use the word 'well') it can be a life defining meal. Don't take my word for it- my girlfriend never <em>used</em> to eat beef, but now she's known to enjoy herself a nice juicy steak on the
        <strong>reg</strong>, and really who can you blame her when you have a cut of meat so perfectly cooked that not eating it would feel like a crime? Not me, that's for damn sure.</p>

    <p>Now to cook one on a grill or a stovetop, it is safe to say that is a skill, but one which fades when not in use- and in this economy it'd be super easy to forget how to cook a steak, lets be real here. That being said, the method for cooking this
        steak I'm about to lay on you takes out all the guess work and is going to render a consistently amazing steak each and every time.</p>

    <h3>But don't take my word for it!</h3>

    <p>To make this recipe you're going to need a few tools. You're going to need:</p>
    <ul>
        <li> a water circulater (hereafter will be referred to as a sous vide)</li>
        <li> some plastic bags (ideally vacuum seal bags but a ziplock will work fine-<a href="https://youtu.be/XrZPLF0ezw8">click here></a> to see how to seal bags without a vacuum sealer</li>
        <li>A large pot or plastic container</li>
        <li>A frying pan or a cast iron skillet</li>
        <li> tongs or a flipper whatever works</li>
        <li><b>not super crucial, but some clips to attach the bag to the side of your container</b></li>
    </ul>
    </p>
    <p>Now that we know what we are using to cook- don't expect this to be a 20 minute option. This method takes time to make it work- we're talking minimum 1 hour and that's just cooking. For this, we're talking more like 2 hours. Maybe even 2.5 hours.
        That being said, the time your steak spends in the bath (you'll see when you're cooking)is probably one of the least time sensitive parts of this or any recipe. Miss by a few minutes- no problem. Miss by an hour? No ish. That being said, lets
        get into the meat and potatoes of this recipe (no potatoes are actually featured in this recipe, sorry not sorry)
    </p>
    <p>
        <h3>The stars of the show</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>8 oz Ribeye steak</li>
            <li>2 knobs of butter</li>
            <li>a sprig of thyme, or rosemary, whatevs you prefer</li>
            <li>salt and pepper to taste</li>
        </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
        <h2>Bringing it all together</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Fill your container with enough water, and set your sous vide to 130 F</li>
            <li>Place your steak into a bag with a single knob of butter and seal</li>
            <li>Place your bagged steak into the sous vide bath, maybe clip it to the side, and let it cook for 2.5 hours</li>
            <li>Once its time to take out of the bath, drain any excess liquid from the bag, and pat your steak dry, also salt each side</li>
            <li>Heat your pan to hot, super hot, like med high/high and slam that knob of butter in</li>
            <li>Right after that put your steak in that badboy and let it sizzle for a minute on each side- get a sick ass sear</li>
            <li>Plate that shit and serve</li>
        </ol>
    </p>
    <p> Now what is absolutely wild about this is that this method is going to produce an absolute banger of a steak each and every time. What's even more wild though is that you don't have to let this steak sit! Once you sear it (which is optional but kind
        of necessary, unless you don't care about how your food looks) you can cut into it however you damn please. Just insanity! And make no mistake, this steak is going to be absolutely insane. Enjoy</p>

    <p>
