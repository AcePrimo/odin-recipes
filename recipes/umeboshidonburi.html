        <p>What can you say about rice? It is what it is, a staple. If you make a good bowl of rice the best compliment you may receive is "hey man good rice" but realistically, silence is what you are looking for. A rice that has been perfectly made deserves
            no praise, and none is needed. It's there for you like a comfort blanket- and it's sure to pad out the rest of a lovely meal. Why would you want to mess with that? Who the <strong>fuck</strong> are you to be trying to pefect the wheel? Well
            I'm not suggesting that here. This isn't broke, I'm not fixing it. I'm just suggesting a way to give it some extra flair. Think of it as a nice set of rims for your car. Or some <em>sick</em> ass RGB for your new tower.</p>

        <p>I am not going to lie, I don't have skill when it comes to cooking rice, but I have a really nice rice cooker so I don't <em><strong>have</strong></em> to be skilled. Should you learn how to cook rice? Sure yeah for sure, whatever- listen it's
            not a dying language. You don't need to feel like you are preserving some lost art, this isn't elven weaponcrafting, you aren't smithing rings of power; you're making rice- but if you feel differently, you go right for it and shine on you
            crazy diamond.That being said- this recipe is crazy easy and simple. There's not a lot to this but there's elegance in simplicity, and this is elegant as <strong><em>FUCK</em></strong>. </p>

                <li>a rice cooker</li>
                <li>a mortar and pestle</li>

        </div>
        <div class="para">
            <ul>
                <li>1 cup rice uncooked</li>
                <li>2 umeboshi plums</li>
                <li>salt to taste</li>
            </ul>
    </p>

    <div class="header2">
        <h2>Putting it all together</h2>
    </div>
    <div class="para">
        <ol>
            <li>Wash your rice (seriously, wash it)</li>
            <li>Put your washed rice into your rice cooker with the appropriate amount of water (rice cooker should indicate what amount of water is needed)</li>
            <li>Whilst your rice is cooking, pit your umeboshi and using your mortar and pestle, make a paste of the umeboshi, set paste into a small bowl </li>
            <li>When your rice has cooked, fluff it up, and put into a bowl</li>
            <li>Add umeboshi paste to the rice, ensuring rice is as evenly coated as you can get it</li>
        </ol>
</p>
<p>So that is it. Not a lot to it, but it's different and crazy refreshing. It goes nicely with pretty much any cut of meat you'd want to serve on top of rice. You can serve it with sashimi, or vegetables, or whatever you want. I'm a fan of eating it on
    it's own, and I'm hoping you like it too!
