    <h1>The weird and wacky world of Umoboshi Rice </h1>

    <h2>This one is something special</h2>
    <p>What can you say about rice? It is what it is, a staple. If you make a good bowl of rice the best compliment you may receive is "hey man good rice" but realistically, silence is what you are looking for. A rice that has been perfectly made deserves
        no praise, and none is needed. It's there for you like a comfort blanket sure to pad out the rest of a lovely meal. Why would you want to mess with that? Who the <strong>fuck</strong> are you to be trying to pefect the wheel? Well I'm not suggesting
        that here. This isn't broke, I'm not fixing it. I'm just suggesting a way to give it some extra flair. Think of it as a nice set of rims for your car. Or some <em>sick</em> ass RGB for your new tower.</p>

    <p>I am not going to lie, I don't have skill when it comes to cooking rice, but I have a really nice rice cooker so I don't <em><strong>have</strong></em> to be skilled. Should you learn how to cook rice? Sure yeah for sure, whatever- listen it's not
        a dying language. You don't need to feel like you are preserving some lost art, this isn't elven weaponcrafting, you aren't smithing rings of power; you're making rice- but if you feel differently, you go right for it and shine on you crazy diamond.That
        being said- this recipe is crazy easy and simple. There's not a lot to this but there's elegance in simplicity, and this is elegant as <strong><em>FUCK</em></strong>. </p>
